"Tile Puzzle" solver using I-DFS, BFS and A* algorithms.

Running main.py looking for a file "input.txt".
The input will be:
first line: algorithm: 1 : I-DFS, 2 : BFS, 3 : A*
second line: grid length, (rows and cols are equals)
third line: the grid seperated by '-' e.g: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-0-8

the output file will be one line contains the operations (L, R, U, D) as the solution,
number of developed nodes and the cost of the solution.
